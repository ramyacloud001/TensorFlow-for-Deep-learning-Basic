# Deep Learning with Tensorflow Basics:

In this repo, I am going to share few basics that how to work with Deep learning Tensorflow Framework.


### Topics covered 

        - What are Tensors:
        - Difference in scalar , vector , Matrix and Tensor:
        - How to create a tensor:
        - How to Access tensors:
        - How to change tensors values if Already Define:
        - Creating Random values:
        - Shuffle concept:
        - Numpy to TensorFlow:
        - TensorFlow to Numpy:
        - Finding Extra sections After creating Tensors:
        - Basics Math Operations
        - Reshape and Transpose 
        - Changing Datatype 
        - Squeeze 
        - Finding Min  , Max , Sum , mean , argmax , argmin ,square , sqrt ,log
        - Checking Gpu Availability



### First lets check the difference between scalar , vector ,Matrix and tensor

In mathematical terms, a scalar is a single value, a vector is an ordered array of values, a matrix is a 2D array of values, and a tensor is a multi-dimensional array of values. In PyTorch, scalars are represented as 0-dimensional tensors, vectors are represented as 1-dimensional tensors, matrices are represented as 2-dimensional tensors, and tensors can have more than 2 dimensions.

### Difference between tf.constant and tf.Variable concepts:

tensors created by tf.constant are Immutable which means we cannot replace tensor values 
But tensors created by tf.Variable are Mutable so they can change there tensor values:
